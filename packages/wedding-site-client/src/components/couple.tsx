            Megan and Jake met at the age of 16 in June 2009 at the Rite Hite YMCA in northern Milwaukee, where they both trained to be lifeguards.
            Megan had missed one class in her session, and had to attend a class from the next session to receive her certification.
            Lucky for her, that class was Jake's first in his session. The two found chemistry fast, and though she didn't need to,
            Megan continued coming back to Jake's classes in order to see more of him. After a few weeks of getting to know one another,
            Jake asked Megan out, meeting an unfortunate rejection! Discouraged, Jake decided to leave Megan alone for awhile,
            in the hope that she might eventually come to her senses.

            Then, in February 2010, Megan and Jake got to talking again, and found the same chemistry they had left behind. Not wanting
            to seem too eager, Jake asked if she wanted to see a movie <i>as friends</i>. This led to their fateful first date on March 13,
            2010. They continued to see movies together over the next few months; meeting at other times was difficult due to the driving
            distance. The relationship bloomed into a rocky and unpredictable mess that lasted through several breakups over 2 years. Every
            attempt to end the relationship led to an inevitable meetup and resolution. Not even the confusion of their teenage years could
            keep the two apart.

            As the years went by, Megan and Jake grew together, bettering each other along the way. Wanting to remain close to her, Jake chose
            to attend Marquette University for college, knowing that Megan was going to follow her sister's footsteps to the Milwaukee
            Institute of Art &amp; Design. They had revealed their lack of fear of commitment early on in their relationship, agreeing that
            if they could last through college, they would get married. As Jake's 2015 college graduation and move to Seattle approached,
            he knew he was going to have to get down on one knee soon. Taking Megan completely by surprise, he proposed the morning of September
            13, 2014, in Madison. The expected <b>YES</b> came with tears of joy.

            The now-betrothed couple set an initial wedding date of April 7, 2018, wanting to wait until Megan had graduated college. Through
            some convincing from their parents, the date was revised to June 23 of that year (which ended up being very lucky, because April 7
            was cold and snowy!). The next 3 and a half years were filled with chaos, with Jake moving to Seattle and then deciding to move back.
            But whatever happened, Megan and Jake knew they would have each other. As the date approaches, they are counting down the seconds,
            excited to profess their undying love for each other in front of family and friends. <b>We can't wait to see you there!</b>
