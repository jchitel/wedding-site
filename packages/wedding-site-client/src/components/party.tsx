                My name is Megan Mellenthien and I am currently living in Colorado pursuing a Masters in Music.
                I have been friends with Megan for 15 years. Those years have been filled with so much laughter
                and joy that there are too many memories to recount in such a short paragraph. Even when we went
                to different high schools and colleges, every time we saw each other we picked up right where we
                left off with that day‚Äôs shenanigans. From playing pretend in our backyard to watching her try on a
                wedding dress, there has never been a time I doubted her sincere heart. We have shared many times
                together and I‚Äôm so excited to share in her happiness as she marries the man of her dreams and
                prepares to share moments with him as she continues on her journey.

                I met the man they call Jacob Edward Chitel when he was a mere boy. Who would have thought kindergarten
                would become middle school to high school and then to best men? The world out there is unpredictable but
                Jake has been a rock for me through it all. We've weathered storms, we've shared blood and guts have been
                poured out on countless occasions. Yes, this man they call Jacob Edward Chitel may be 25 years old but to
                me, he is ageless and just like the best of wines, he is getting sweeter and more expensive as the years
                go by.

                Hi everyone, I am Samm Snyder and I am a senior at the University of Alabama studying development
                of human biology on the pre-med track as an aspiring surgeon. The Chitel family have been very good
                friends with our family since we were very young, and therefore they feel like family to us. When Megan
                came into Jake's life we were soon introduced to her and fell in love with her and them as a couple. She
                soon became part of the family with all of us! Through their years together we have spent so many holidays
                and warm summer days together with many laughs and lots of love. I have been so blessed that we have
                become to close and honored that they asked me to be a part of their big day.

                Kinesiology and UW-Madison with the hopes of going on to become a physical therapist. I am so excited
                to be a part of the wedding and share in Jake and Megan's celebration!

                It‚Äôs a pretty simple story how I know Jake and Megan. I met Jake about 17 years ago because our parents
                are very close friends that knew each other growing up. We spend a lot of time together hanging out,
                playing volleyball, going on vacations and even having thanksgiving together. The Chitels were always
                family to us. Then I met Megan about 5 years ago when Jake introduced her to us and she immediately
                became part of the crazy Chitel/Snyder clan! We always have such a great time together and I cannot
                wait to be apart of your  day! Love you guys üíú

                Hi! I'm Shannon, a service designer in Illinois. I met Megan in college at the Milwaukee Institute of
                Art and Design, where we both majored in Industrial Design. My favorite memory with Megan is when she
                came to visit. We sat on the roof and laughed about silly things so hard we couldn't breathe. I am so
                happy to be a part of this celebration for Megan and Jake!

                I met Megan in a mutual class my freshman year in college and though we were different majors,
                we had several classes together over the four years. In between classes, you would find us playing
                Minecraft in the cafeteria, building castles and fighting zombies. Since graduating, we have both
                kept in touch and continued our gaming tradition with a little comfort food and a good movie.
                I think very fondly of those times and always enjoy the little break we both get to take from
                ‚Äúadulting‚Äù to just hang out :)

                Megan knew me before I knew me; I am Megan's second cousin. Megan was a close companion throughout
                our younger years. I found her fun and fascinating even then. Her friendship made my childhood full of
                good cheer as well as many odd stories. Throughout much of high school, Megan was my confidant and friend.
                Megan and Jake were my rock during an upsetting Junior prom, and she provided me with more than I could
                have asked for that night. Reading this, she may not realize how much her and Jake's presence was
                comforting, but I will assure her that little has meant more to me than seeing what love can be. As I
                have gone through my own long-term relationship, I have come to see her and Jake's bond as a model for
                what love should look like. In the end, I could not be more grateful for her lessons in how to love and
                love well. She has given her wisdom even when I haven't asked, and I think these are the lessons I have
                needed and cherished the most. I could not be more grateful for Megan's friendship and her presence in my
                life. She is my cousin; but, more so, she is my friend.

                I met Jake freshman year of high school. Through all-nighters and shared interests a lifelong bond was
                formed. I met Megan later on, and we have been fast friends since. I am looking forward to many years
                more of good times and new adventures.

                Jake and I first met when we became partners in a Computer Engineering project at Marquette University.
                We bonded over a shared interest in Computer Science, draft beer, and immature jokes. It soon became
                tradition that we would end a long night of programming work with a game of pool at the campus bar. We
                were both terrible at playing pool, but it was fun because we would talk about anything and forget about
                the harsh school workload. After years of hanging out and programming together (we still collaborate on
                projects to this day!), he became one of my closest friends. I am so happy for Megan and Jake, and I wish
                them good fortune in their future together!

                Jake and I met in freshman year of high school. We worked together on a bunch of projects, unsurprising
                considering we had almost exactly the same classes. As we started college, Jake helped me discover my
                interest in developing software. We both embarked on the great journey to Seattle together, and although
                we live live 3000 miles apart now, we're still great friends. I know whenever I return home, I'll always
                be able to find a friend in Jake.

                I've known Jake since high school, where we engineered and ran track together. We had a blast making
                a Rube Goldberg machine our senior year and spending the evenings playing video games. I'm excited
                to watch Jake and Megan start their life together.

                I met Jake back in the olden days of high school. We quickly built up a rapport based on our mutual
                interest in things such as technology and not being in Spanish class. Despite going to college
                several hours apart from each other, we have remained good friends. The strong bond we formed is helped
                by both of us finding work in areas that both utilize technology and do not utilize Spanish.

                I met Jake in engineering class early on in high school. We had similar interests and got along well,
                and he was quickly added to the group of friends I already knew from grade school. We ended up going
                to different colleges, but I'd visit him at Marquette whenever I was home for break, and once, he and
                another friend made the drive down to Notre Dame for a football weekend. I live in Florida now,
                and we see each other even less, but when we do, we don't ask how the other is doing; we ask what we
                thought about the newest Star Wars movie. Although that annoys my parents who want to know what my
                friends are doing with their lives, I think it's the mark of a strong friendship.
